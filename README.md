# median-prime-numbers

## Overview 
Given an upper limit of n, write a javascript function that will find the median prime number(s) of the set of prime numbers less than n. 

## Example 
- If n = 10, the set of prime numbers less than 10 is [2,3,5,7], and so the medians are [3,5] 
- If n = 18, the set of prime numbers less than 18 is [2,3,5,7,11,13,17], and so the median is [7] 

## Please use folowwing steps to configure application:
- Clone repository: `git close https://github.com/monika-khatri/median-prime-numbers.git`
- `cd median-prime-number`
- To install dependencies: `npm install`
- To run test: `npm test`
- To start server: `npm start`

## Fetch Medians of prime numbers less than given upperLimit

Use `http://localhost:3000?upperLimit=10` to see the results
